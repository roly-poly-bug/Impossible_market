# Architecture

Impossible Market starts as two local processes: a React browser application and
a FastAPI service. The API owns persistence and will later own the boundary to
ML inference. This prevents UI code from depending on model implementation
details.

The initial domain model reserves four core entities:

- `User`: a known visitor identity.
- `Product`: an item that can receive interactions.
- `Session`: a browsing period, optionally linked to a user.
- `Event`: an impression, view, favorite, add-to-cart, or purchase interaction.

SQLite is the local default. SQLAlchemy models keep a future PostgreSQL migration
possible. Schema migrations will be introduced with Alembic when persistence is
activated; the API currently does not create or mutate a database.
